			<h3>Explosive Revelations: MAPPA Studio's Controversial Treatment of Jujutsu Kaisen Animators</h3>
			<p>The anime season highlights Jujutsu Kaisen, a leading shounen series with a dedicated fan base. However, discussions have arisen regarding how studio MAPPA handles its staff. In late September, it was disclosed that MAPPA mandated its employees to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), preventing them from revealing any information about working conditions during Gege Akutami's anime production. Despite MAPPA's attempt to maintain confidentiality, the leaked contract has emboldened Jujutsu Kaisen professionals to speak out against the studio, sharing their experiences on social media.</p>
